FOSSology+SPDX (R) Installation Documentation

Introduction
============
This document is designed to help you get FOSSologySPDX installed and ready
to use. As of now, there are 2 ways to install FOSSologySPDX. You can install it 
from scratch on top of an instance of FOSSology(latest version are ensured), 
or you can make a new instance of FOSSologySPDX on Amazon Web Services.

===========================================
The following are instructions if you are installing the module on top of an already 
existing installation of sollology. 

Section 1 - Installation Instructions for module
Section 2 - Installation Instructions for database
Section 3 - After Module Installation

Section 1
===========================================
(In examples, # is as root, $ is mortal)
Before you FOSSologySPDX, you need install FOSSology first. 
You can find the discussion on how to install or use the FOSSology software,
please see the Documentation, available at 
http://www.fossology.org/projects/fossology/wiki/SysConfigSrc. 

1. If you have any old FOSSologySPDX php code installed you want to remove from the
   system you can run
   # make uninstall
   If you have an existing install that you want to transition, be sure to
   back up your PHP pages, repository, database, and config files before proceeding.

   If you have any old FOSSologySPDX installs(configuration files, log files and database) you want to remove from
   the system you can run the fossyspdx-cleanold script
   # utils/fossyspdx-cleanold

2. Install FOSSologySPDX   
   ***Installation need Perl Text/Template.pm to generate configuration file***.
   You may need install Perl Text/Template.pm by running "$perl -MCPAN -e 'install Text::Template' " or
   "yum install perl-Text-Template"
   
   # make install
   
   Move to [db] folder
   # ./fossyspdx-createdb
   
   Run FOSSology+SPDX postinstall script
   # /usr/lib/fossology/fossyspdx-postinstall


You're done, point your web browser at the new install
(http://yourhostname/repo/) and start using FOSSologySPDX!


Section 2 - Installation Instructions for database
===========================================
(In examples, # is as root, $ is mortal)
After you install FOSSology database, 
please refer to README under [db] folder to establish FOSSology+SPDX tables manually.
You can also run the following line to create tables in FOSSology database automatically.
# ./fossyspdx-createdb


Section 3 - After Installation
==============================
Congratulations, FOSSologySPDX is now installed!

You might want to tune your system to fit the work, the following you may need to consider:

Configure and tune the configuration files
   ->Configuring PHP
   Some php config variables may need to be adjusted for FOSSology+SPDX. We don't
   provide an automated way to do this because it can be specific to your
   particular install if you are using php for other things. Edit your
   php.ini file for apache (location dependent on your install, but
   probably something like /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini) and make adjustments
   that will work for your system and usage. Here are some things to
   consider:
   *max_execution_time = 36000
   This controls how long, in seconds, a php process is allowed to run.
   For particularly large jobs, or if your system is slow you may need to increase this.
   *memory_limit = 702M
   *post_max_size = 701M
   *upload_max_filesize = 700M
   ->Configuring FOSSology+SPDX folder(default setting is suggested)
   fossologyspdx.conf(location dependent on your install, but probably like /etc/fossology/fossologyspdx.conf)
   Here are some things to consider:

   # project logdir
   LOGDIR controls where log files are put(now, only when the process running spdx_license_once.php
    with 'packageNameInLog' setting will generate log)

   # project output_file dir
   OUTPUT_FILE controls where the temporary files are generated during the process 
   of generating SPDX file(tag,notice, etc) in Web UI


You can now point your web browser at the new install
(http://yourhostname/repo/) and start using FOSSology!

You should login to FOSSology with the default fossy/fossy user and
password and:
1) create yourself a user with administrative privileges
2) change the default password for user fossy
3) customize (if desired) your FOSSology website using the directions at 
http://www.fossology.org/projects/fossology/wiki/Config-How_to_Configure_the_FOSSology_site
4) generate SPDX file under menu [SPDX] or 
   access command line API to real-time scan license information in SPDX spec 
===========================================




===========================================
The following are instructions if you are creating a new instance of FOSSologySPDX from 
the Amazon Web Service image.

Section 1 - Crate a new instace from image
Section 2 - Configure Firewall
Section 3 - After Module Installation

Section 1 - Crate a new instance from image
===========================================
The following assumes that you have already navigated to your Amazon EC2 dashboard.
(https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)

1) Click "Launch Instance. Click on next (We'll be using the classic wizard).
2) When Choosing an AMI, click on the "Community AMI's" tab. Make sure you're viewing all images 
   and then type "fossology". Select the AMI with the manifest "186210339502/fossology-spdx"
3) Click through and customize your instance if desired. Make sure to give it a name and create a keypair.
4) When you get to the "Configure Firewall" page move on to the next section

Section 2 - Configure Firewall
===========================================
Feel free to configure the firewall in any way that you want. The following is the minimum 
needed to get an instance running and reachable.

1) If you already have a Security group that you setup, use that. Otherwise, click "Create a new Security Group"
2) give it a name and description. 
3) Under "crate a new rule" select HTTP and leave the source 0.0.0.0/0. Click "Add Rule".
4) If you want to SSH into your instance, you will need to open that port as well. 

Section 3 
===========================================

1) Click through until you exit the wizard. 
2) Once your instance's state changes to "Running", you will have a working instance of FOSSologySPDX
3) you can view your instance by typing [PUBLIC_DNS_OF_INSTANCE]/repo/ in your browser. 
   ex: http://ec2-54-234-238-63.compute-1.amazonaws.com/repo/
4) Congratulations! You now have a working instance of FOSSologySPDX
===========================================
